#Hologram-Go-Library

## Introduction
This is a library built for using our REST APIs.


## Installation

One nice thing about Go is how easy it is to work with packages.
First, run:

```go
go get github.com/hologram-io/hologram-go
```

All you need to do after that is add this snippet of code in your source:

import (
	<your other imports go here>
	"github.com/hologram-io/hologram-go-library"
	<your other imports go here>
)

in your main folder.
