#Hologram-Go-Library

## Introduction
This is a library built for using our REST APIs.


## Installation

One nice thing about Go is how easy it is to work with packages.
First, run:

go get github.com/hologram-io/hologram-go-library

All you need to do after that is add this snippet of code in your source:

import (
	<your other imports go here>
	"github.com/hologram-io/hologram-go-library"
	<your other imports go here>
)

in your main folder.

## Support

TODOs:
1. Uppercase Unicode for functions - so can be seen externally from package.
2. 404 error in Parse function, maybe invalid credentials?
3. Add unit tests + examples
